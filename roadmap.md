Roadmap
=======

Here are my broad thoughts on a basic next 1 - 2 year strategy:

## Admin & Official

- [ ] Keep drafting out the documents for structure and content (blog posts, viral images, etc...)
- [ ] Create a brand identity for the concept

## Digital Infrastructure

- [ ] Setting up some sort of blog / site and being more public about it
- [ ] Mailing list
- [ ] Twitter, Facebook (ugh), IndieWeb (Known Platform or Disapora pod), Discourse Forum

## Outreach & Marketing

- [ ] Building awareness / hype around the concept
- [ ] Freedom inspired / fight surveillance mixtape
- [ ] Figure out exact products to focus on selling
- [ ] Getting some Purism laptops machines for testing & use
- [ ] Figuring out a lower price point machine + ideal OS with default apps (trying out Elementary right now)
- [ ] Create a plan forward of which suite of apps / tools to keep investing in growing
- [ ] Start a huge campaign / outreach thing to official "launch"

## Funding

- [ ] Create a plan for seed funding for initial products ($75 - 150k)
- [ ] Crowd funding / pre-order hybrid

## Physical Storefronts

- [ ] A pop-up style shop in Berlin that would exist for 1 - 3 months as a sort of "pilot" to test out the model, gauge interest, and document approach
- [ ] Depending on result of pop-up shop, either try in another city, keep going, resort to online only
