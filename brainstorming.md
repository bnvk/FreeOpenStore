Brainstorming
=============

Free Open Store is a business, a community and a conversation about the nature of freedom and capitalism- specifically in relation to digital products, tools and services.

The majority of digital products, tools and services are owned by planetary-scale organisations. As these monoliths grow in size and number, they begin to own and control more and more layers within the ‘stacks’ from the hardware to software to cloud. The problem is that their businesses models depend on our data. Our data, that represents us, is transmitted, processed and stored by companies that operate with a bottom line of profit. This matters because the digital products and services we use are increasingly exerting influence on how power is distributed among us. These tech giants are reshaping our citizenship.

Freed Open Store is a physical response to this problem. It will be a (series of) physical store(s), consisting of:

- **Ethical Products** - The store will sell new consumer digital products, 'out of the box' and ready to go just like in an Apple Store. The key difference is the store will only stock ethical products that support and promote freedom :D
- **Hacker Bar** - Like Apple's "Genius Bar" the Freedom Store offers free service, support (within reason) for products purchased at the Freedom Store. At the Hacker Bar customers can also access general computer help charged at an hourly rate - this service will, for instance, help individuals migrate from Windows or Mac to Linux or incorporate freedom respecting apps / tools in their existing operating system.
- **Educational Events** - The Freedom.Store will host weekly events in the evenings and on weekends that teach and help people learn about their digital tools and how to be more empowered by them.
- **Sustainable Funding for FOSS** - as per the primary goal of Freedom.Store to make open technologies more robust, usable, and improving. A percentage of both sales and support provided by the Freedom.Store organization will always filter back into FOSS software and hardware projects in order to provide sustainable funding so people can actually afford to exist in society, eat, pay their rent and bills.

Free Open Store will operate an open business model, where only the trade mark will be owned with the ambition that other Freedom.Stores will open around the world. So other people can sign up the franchise agreement and start a Freedom.Store branded store in their local area.
