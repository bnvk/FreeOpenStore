Organizational Culture & Policies
=================================

Perhaps the most crucial aspect to get right, in the entire Free Open Store experiment, is that of creating healthy culture as well as checks, balances, and codes of conduct. Getting (and keeping) this correct, is what will make or break Free Open Store.

Many aspects of Free Open Store are heavily influenced by the Whole Earth Catalogue and what it sought to achieve for human kind. This paragraph from the catalogues expresses what that incredible endeavour set out to achieve:

> "We are as gods and might as well get good at it. So far, remotely done power and glory—as via government, big business, formal education, church—has succeeded to the point where gross defects obscure actual gains. In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of intimate, personal power is developing—power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested. Tools that aid this process are sought and promoted by the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG" [~learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog)

While not officially a political endeavor, Freedom.Store does have some aspect of politics and ethics which deter from what many are used to. Politically, if Freedom.Store itself was a sentient entity that could align itself with a political party, that party would be a hybrid of both direct and representational democracy, socialism, communism, and a healthy dose of anarchism. The ethics and values embodied in Freedom.Store seek to create a more fair and sustainable future.

bnvk: So far this draft was penned by me Brennan, if would like to leave a comment about a specific part, please do so above / below that line with your initials and add your name to contributors section below so I know who you are :)

## 0. Code of Conduct

All participiants, contributors, and representatives of Free Open Store must adhere to our code of conduct when participating in Free Open Store public and privately.

Here is a [code of conduct](http://opensourcedesign.net/code-of-conduct/) I (Brennan Novak) wrote for the Open Source Design community. I need to apply some update / suggestions from some review- but I am otherwise happy with it, and I think it applies quite well for the Freedom.Store

## 1. Dress Code

There MUST NOT ever be a "dress code" for any official human* representiive of the Freedom.Store organization at one of our physical stores, locations, or pop-ups. Simple unobtrusive pins, stickers, hats, or jewelry might emerge and representatives can choose to wear these optionally either while at a Freedom.Store or in normal life.

While dress codes applify branding and helps customers and other would be store goers identify staff membmers, dress codes (and uniforms for that matter) also dehumanizes and turns human beings into walking billboards. I mean, who really likes wearing a uniform or work attire? It's usually tacky and silly. Additionally, without this divisive physical differentiator- we hope staff and the public can engage in a more communual way. As per the optional accessories- human beings do this naturally and have been doing so in tribal cultures for thousands of years- they adorn themselves to express devotion or social cohesion to a group or deal. If people like or promote the Freedom.Store organization, that is wonderful. This "free" expression should never be manditory or regulated in any fashion.

## 2. Finances & Assets

All forms of money transference, accumulation, and spending MUST be handled in a 100% transparent fashion at all times and in perpetuity. This information should be easy to obtain, copy, and understand. It will be licensed with fair open source data licenses.

Most capitalist businesses thrive on witholding (or selectively sharing) key information from employees, the public, and other competing businesses and organizations. Freedom.Store is above that manipulative behavior. We believe that through radical transparency we can achieve a greater effieciency both internally and within larger eco-system(s) that operates independently aside from Freedom.Store itself. Groups that provide services and tools that Freedom.Store sells or offers services for can greatly benefit from this. Other groups wishing to have Freedom.Store sell or support their tools can also use this open data to determine if, when, and how is best for them to engage. But won't this data be exploitable by would be "competitors" ? The answer is both yes and no. The Apple, Google, and Microsoft of yesteryear will be able to easily monitor how well Freedom.Store is performing, but neither them nor others will be able to "compete" with Freedom.Store, as we are inherantly not a capitalist entity, thus competing by trade secrets and profit does not actually apply to our business model.

## 3. Advertising & Marketing

 All forms of advertising, promotion, or boosterism MUST occur in ethical ways and ONLY via ethical open channels of communication

Adverising when done ethically, is about allowing would be people in need of a given tool or service to find the thing they need. Advertising becomes highly unethical and manipulative when it becomes involved in convincing people to buy or use things they don't neccessarily need.

**Unethical Examples**

- Television commericals
- Radio advertisements
- Print magazine advertisments
- Facebook or Google (web or mobile) click advertisements
- Large privately owned billboards that dominate visual shared spaces
- Selling products which do not adhere to enough of our criteria for additional donations

**Ethical Examples**

- Personal outreach and advocacy via Free channels (internet, word of mouth, etc...)
- Small unobstrusive signboards
- Wearing of Free Open Store branded clothing or accessories
- Public / community owned (open) bulletin boards and windows
- Stickers, stencils, or graffitti in physical spaces
- Speaking at open conferences and un-conferences

One might see might see abstaining from something innocuous like click-ads on the internet, while encouraging graffitti for advertising purposes, to be a dubious choice- we encourage you to question the underlying belief systems and societal biases associated with each methods of communication. Consider what the world famous British artist Banksy once said about advertising:

"They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity" http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-blog/blogs/banksy-on-advertising.jpg

Graffitti, on the other hand, is a democratizing art / communication form owned by no one- it seems that encouraging people to spread the Freedom.Store brand is highly in line with our ideals about creating a more free, open, and fair society.  We belive investing our time and effort (and more importantly our financial assets) into non-free communication channels only helps allow the current power structures of the world to maintain the status quo instead of achieve radical change (e.g. the US presidential election cycle).

 In addition to the more clearly defined cases of what we determine unethical and ethical advertising (stated above), it seems highly fortuitous for the Freedom.Store to be open to allowing non-free channels to help promote and do free (as in beer) marketing on it's behalf.  Examples of this is are:

- Being interviewed in magazines and news outlets both print and web based
- Doing live appearences on radio and television
- Speaking at non-open conferences and events that make some basic level of donation to Freedom.Store

## 4. Centralization & Decentralization

We SHOULD NOT allow, build, or depend on centralized or single points of failure for the organization at all levels

Centralization is a term in technology circles usually referring to mega-platforms like Facebook, Apple, and Google and while easier to build and maintain- centralization is often seen as weeker, exploitable, and/or corruptible. The better (albeit less popular) alternative is often referred to as decentralization. However, the concept of this applies beyond internet based platforms and software engineering jargon. Large corporations are in essence "centralized" as our lots of forms of government. Thus, Freedom.Store should default to the decentralized approach both for the tools we use to run the organization, the tools we sell, and the otherwise promote and sell.

Technologicaly speaking, Freedom.Store itself would not build or maintain centralized infrastructure for it's customers to use such as Apple's iCloud which is used for contact, calendar, and file syncing and relies on centralized server architecture that Apple maintains. The dectranlized alternative approach Freedom.Store would participate in and help create, would be running Tor relays and exit nodes while contributing to open source projects which rely on decentralized tools such as Syncthing, Ricochet Messenger, OnionShare, or OwnCloud.

Non-engineering example of decentralization, could exist in the decision making process itself. Consider an organization that makes decisions based on group consensus, instead of top-down hierarchigal structure. This is not to say there won't be separations of "focus" or "specialization" such that some people who deal with physical and graphic design or decorating display of a store, while never learning how to install Linux from scratch on a compute- this area of expertise might form a "design team" while a completely different team might be composed of technical members (some of whom might also be on the design team), while others are strictly on the technical team. If we eliminate the idea of a team "leaders" and instead opt for organizational tools, frameworks, and policies which do consensus based polling and (if needed) voting, decisions can be made without forming centralized bottlenecks (managers, bosses, etc...) who's primary jobs are relaying orders and regulating information flow between lower ranked workers and higher ranking power structures. Some examples of this would be borrowing gesutures from Occupy Wall Street https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement_hand_signals having organization members meet in huddles / groups and express gestures to "consensus poll" what a given team should decide to do on a given challenge, issue, or decision. On the surface they may seem like it takes longer to achieve consensus, but in theory this should allow the organization as whole to make less mistakes to begin with and foster greater respect and trust amongst members.

This criteria is perhaps the most flexible of all criterias (and should thus be paid special attention to for later refinement) as sometimes the centralized approach is orders of magnitude more effecient or easier to use, create, or maintain. If this is ever the case, we should seek to benefit from this effiency while considering paths to building decentralized alternatives on a longer time scale or if the centralized approach is ultimately the best approach as it significantly benefits numerous other decetralized components.

## 5. Working Hours

The organization MUST NOT ask representatives to work more than they are comfortable or is healthy

bnvk: This section is highly up for consideration & thought. I have no idea what is the best approach to this yet. Here are some rough points

The 20 - 40 part / full-time work week has seemed to emerge societally as somewhat "healthy" in China, Sillicon Valley, and other "get rich" sectors, it is common for workers to work 50 - 70 hours per week on average. Wether the later is health is debatible.

My past experiences at full time startups that have "open vacation policy" which meant employees could schedule as much time off as they needed felt nice. No one ever exercised this beyond normal week or two off here and there. Not sure how this would play out with recurring instances or longer than month vacations from people who become crucial to Freedom.Store's progress. My instinct is- the organization should be decentralized and balanced enough that it is resiliant enough to adapt.

Micro commitments- I really like the idea of figuring out how to pay people who can only make "micro" commitments such as a few hours of design, development, or store staffing per week

From what I've seen, things like open vacation policies are, more often than not, used to guilt employees into self-restriction. For that reason I think it's important to have set *minimums* for vacations, but perhaps with a policy of open discussion around assisting employees with any additional requirements they might have. I'm very anti the 'we're a family' narrative within an organisation as I don't think it's healthy, but I'm sure there is middle ground between that and traditional employment models. - jp

Also important that payscale reflects respect for employees. Obviously there needs to be a balance between sustainability of the business and staff remuneration, but that balance can't result in employees making minimum wage. Employees who feel valued and respected are far more likely to create an atmosphere conducive to community building. - jp

## 6. Compensation

All people earning financial compensation from Freedom.Store MUST also be makers of something

bnvk: also highly rough as an idea... please give me feedback on this one :)

Ideally, the people who receive financial (or other forms) of compensation, will be makers of things that Freedom.Store sells, uses, or offers services for. This ideal will create numerous positive freedback loops within Freedom.Store that allow for progress and integration horizontally and vertically while being holistic and allowing members to get maximum joy from their involvement. However, people can also just be makers of unrelated things for hobby or businesses. How to define "maker" is tricky, but it roughly means one who create something from nothing, remix or refashions from existing things, or contributes to the creative work of others. Examples: painting, music, furniature modifications,  postcard making, photography, open source software contributions, scientific research, DJ'ing, and punk rock zines are a few examples of the multitude of ways a human can make or create something in the modern world.

The reason for this rule is that people who make things excercise their creativity and autonomy and we think this is a fundamentally healthy behavior for humans to do. Much of the inefficiencies, carelessness, and waste in the world seems to come from laziness and the fact people in the western world feel "companies" prodvide "products" that do things "for them" which robs the human mind of the experience that we are magical creatures that have power to create, share, and help one another collectively as a community.

## 7. Add some more...

Seriously, whatever you think would belong in a "new employee manual" or an"about page" or anything that elaborates on your vision add to the document here :P

## Summation

The Free Open Store experiment will thrive by openess at all levels or it will fail because it is not offering quality tools, services, or an experience that people actually want and need. All of Freedom.Store is up for rewriting or adendum at any point in time. This current draft of culture and policies aims to steer Freedom.Store on a course that will make it sustainable and do some good in the world by making things more open, sustainable, and free. This is the ultimate goal, let that never be forgotten.

### Footnotes

*Not sure what to do about robots (should we ever have robot workers). This opens up a whole barrel of monkeys about sentience, freedom, ethics, etc... my instinct is they should enjoy the same freedoms as humans
