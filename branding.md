Branding
========

The working name for the project that I (bnvk) came up is Freedom.Store which would be the URL (once .store is available), but the storefront would just say Freedom. It is a loose title that I feel decently happy with as it has a degree of "on the nail-ness" that I like that- but also might rub some the wrong way / not resonate as well as other options.

I think this is something that should deffinitely be given some decent thought and consideration, as having a physical location with a catch name + well made sign / logo is hugely advantageous thing to engage a local neighborhood or community with.

Alternate options that can be considered for naming:

- FOSTER (free open source technology education r.... needs a word)
- Project IF
- IF Store
- Decent
